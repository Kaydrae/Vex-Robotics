# Vex-Robots
This vex robot is for the 2015-2016 game Nothing But Net. This repo includes pictures of the robot, what it does and the source code for the program.

# The Robot
The robot is designed to shoot from the colored tile. That is the strategy for this year. The robot is 17 7/8” X 18” X 17” and weighs 20.1lb. We call him KBot 5.0. The robot incudes pneumatics, an ultrasonic, integrated motors, and accelerometer. Pictures of the robot are included.

# The program
The program that is used on this robot is a open source API called conVex. In the code section there is a file called vexuer.c. That file is the only file that has to be edited. Right now it includes just the basics. A holnomic four motor base drive, a 4 motor shooter drive, a one motor kicker, and a one motor inkake, and a autonomous that shoots from the color tile. 

# The future 
The future of this robot is to improve the programming and make the driver control more semi-autonomus, and to use the accelerometer to have the robot drive and pick up teh game object without driver control.
